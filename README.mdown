## Installation

* get the files you want, and put them at the right place;
* clone the repo somewhere, and make the correct symlinks


## Zsh

My `.zshrc` and `.zshenv` are splitted in subfiles. The files loaded are located
in `zshrc.d/enabled`; the files ending in `.mod` are loaded by `zshrc`, while the
ones ending in `.env` are loaded by `zshenv`. The latter is loaded even in
non-interactive sessions.
